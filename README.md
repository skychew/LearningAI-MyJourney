### **Key Questions Answered:**
- How do AI agents differ from traditional automation?
 How do they align with business processes?
- What operational gaps can AI agents address?
- What are the hidden costs of AI adoption?
- How can we ensure ethical AI deployment?
- What KPIs indicate effective AI agent integration?
- How will AI agents evolve in 3-5 years?

### **Insights Provided:**
- Identifying automation-worthy processes
- Matching implementation patterns to business needs
- Building human-AI collaboration frameworks
- Establishing continuous improvement metrics

###**Example Thought:**
Perplexity AI follows a structured search-retrieval-summarization workflow rather than dynamically changing its process autonomously.

## AI Glossary for Non-Technical Managers

1. **Machine Learning (ML)** – A type of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed.  
2. **Deep Learning** – A subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex data like images, speech, and text.  
3. **Neural Networks** – A system of algorithms inspired by the human brain that helps AI recognize patterns and relationships in data.  
4. **Generative AI** – AI models that can create new content, such as text, images, music, or code, based on patterns learned from existing data.  
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – The AI capability that allows computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language.  
6. **Computer Vision** – AI technology that enables computers to analyze and interpret visual information from images or videos.  
7. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – An AI training method where models learn by trial and error, receiving rewards for good decisions.  
8. **Foundation Models** – Large AI models trained on vast datasets that serve as the base for many AI applications, like GPT and BERT.  
9. **Fine-Tuning** – The process of refining a pre-trained AI model with specific data to improve its performance for a particular task.  
10. **Zero-shot Learning** – The ability of an AI model to perform tasks without prior examples, using general knowledge to make predictions.  
11. **Few-shot Learning** – When an AI model learns new tasks with only a small amount of example data.  
12. **Multimodal AI** – AI that can process and integrate multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio, simultaneously.  
13. **Vector Databases** – A specialized type of database optimized for storing and retrieving high-dimensional data, commonly used in AI search and retrieval.  
14. **Embedding** – A numerical representation of words, images, or other data types that AI models use to understand relationships.  
15. **Inference** – The process where an AI model makes predictions or decisions based on new input data.  
16. **Tokenization** – The method of breaking down text into smaller pieces (tokens) to be processed by AI models.  
17. **Bias in AI** – The tendency of AI models to produce skewed or unfair results due to imbalances in training data.  
18. **Hallucination (in AI)** – When an AI model generates incorrect or misleading responses that sound plausible but are factually incorrect.  
19. **Autonomous Agents** – AI systems that can independently perform tasks, make decisions, and adapt to their environment.  
20. **Orchestration (AI Workflows)** – The coordination of multiple AI tools and processes to complete complex tasks efficiently.  
21. **Explainable AI (XAI)** – Techniques that make AI models more transparent, helping humans understand how they arrive at decisions.  
22. **Synthetic Data** – Artificially generated data used to train AI models when real-world data is limited or sensitive.  
23. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – A hybrid AI approach that enhances generative AI by retrieving relevant information from external sources before generating responses.  
24. **AI Ethics** – The study and implementation of responsible AI practices to prevent harm, bias, and misuse.  
25. **Edge AI** – Running AI models on local devices (like smartphones or IoT devices) instead of relying on cloud-based processing.
