# LearningAI-MyJourney (Work in progress)
I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skychew/">Sky</a> this is the brain dump of my AI learning resources that is useful to document. 

**For Non-Technical Managers**</br>
Starting with Keywords is useful</br>
Transformers,
LLMS,
Agents,
Prompting

**TECHNICAL**</br>
Papers might be more interesting to study it using <a href="https://notebooklm.google"> NotebookLM.google.com</a> > Audio overview feature

Foundational Modelling:</br>

Prompting<br>
Use this guide to automatically generate your prompts directly from your Ai bot instead of using another AI to generate them.This is reviewed by perplexity to be the best solution as of Feb 2025:

**LLM**

This is the video that had started my journey into easily understanding LLM's. It covers the core concept up to the success of GPT3 the begining of the AI popularity.</br>

[My summary for non-tech managers ](https://skychew.com/anthropic-building-effective-agents-summary-for-non-tech-managers/)</br>
It helps answer these questions:</br>
- What distinguishes AI agents from traditional automation tools?
- How do agentic systems align with existing business processes?
- What operational gaps can AI agents address in my industry?
- How mature are current AI solutions for business use cases?
- What are the hidden costs of AI adoption?
- How can we ensure ethical AI deployment?
- What KPIs indicate effective AI agent integration?
- How will AI agents evolve in the next 3-5 years?
- The article provides actionable insights into:

Identifying automation-worthy processes
Selecting implementation patterns matched to business needs
Building human-AI collaboration frameworks
Establishing metrics for continuous improvement

Useful thought/example: Given that Perplexity operates using a search model to answer user questions with sources, this aligns more closely with a "workflow" where the steps are largely pre-defined. While the specific search queries and information retrieved may vary, the overall process of search, retrieval, and summarization follows a structured path. It probably does not have the autonomy to dynamically change its process or tool usage in a completely self-directed manner.
