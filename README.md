# LearningAI-MyJourney (WIP)
I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skychew/">Sky</a> this is the brain dump of my AI learning resources that is useful to document. 

**For Non-Technical Managers**</br>
Starting with Keywords is useful</br>
Transformers,
LLMS,
Agents,
Prompting

**TECHNICAL**</br>
Papers might be more interesting to study it using <a href="https://notebooklm.google"> NotebookLM.google.com</a> > Audio overview feature

Foundational Modelling:</br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762"> Transformers* </a> (foundation, self-attention) - 2017

Prompting<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06608">The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques</a>


**LLM**

This is the video that had started my journey into easily understanding LLM's. It covers the core concept up to the success of GPT3 the begining of the AI popularity.</br>

Useful thought/example: Given that Perplexity operates using a search model to answer user questions with sources, this aligns more closely with a "workflow" where the steps are largely pre-defined. While the specific search queries and information retrieved may vary, the overall process of search, retrieval, and summarization follows a structured path. It probably does not have the autonomy to dynamically change its process or tool usage in a completely self-directed manner.
